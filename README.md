# 📍 GPS-Based Restaurant Finding Application (SDLC Documentation)  
*A structured approach to software development using the SDLC framework.*

## 🌟 Project Overview  
This project is a **detailed Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) documentation** for a **GPS-Based Restaurant Finding Application**. The focus is on applying SDLC phases to a real-world problem rather than actual software development.  

> **Problem Statement:** Existing restaurant finder apps lack **real-time updates** and **personalized recommendations**, making dining discovery inefficient.  

To address this, I documented a structured **SDLC approach**, covering:  

✅ **Problem Identification & Statement**  
✅ **Stakeholder Analysis & Requirement Gathering**  
✅ **System Architecture & Design**  
✅ **Development Model Selection (Agile - Scrum)**  
✅ **Testing & Deployment Strategies**  

## 🛠 Technologies & Methodologies  
- **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**  
- **Agile Methodology (Scrum Framework)**  
- **System Design & Technical Documentation**  
- **Requirement Analysis & Stakeholder Identification**  

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters  
This project strengthens my expertise in **software documentation, project planning, and structured problem-solving**—crucial skills for real-world software engineering.  

## 💡 Future Enhancements  
🔹 Expanding documentation with a **prototype implementation**  
🔹 Adding **wireframes & UI/UX design details**  
🔹 Exploring **AI-based restaurant recommendations**
